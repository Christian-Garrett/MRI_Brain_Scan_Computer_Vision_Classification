## Hi my name's Christian <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" alt="hi">

I'm passionate about my work as a Data Scientist because I'm a systems thinker who loves answering questions that begin with 'why'.

### Background

According to the â€˜American Cancer Societyâ€™ (ACS) approximately 23,900 people will develop a malignant tumor affecting their Central Nervous System in 2020. Often considered to be one of the most aggressive diseases for both children and adults, 68% of the individuals that receive this diagnosis will succumb to the illness within a 5-year period based on recent findings from the â€˜National Cancer Instituteâ€™ (NCI). While there are currently more than 120 brain tumor classifications the vast majority fall into one of the following three categories: Gliomas (50.4%), Meningiomas (20.8%) and Pituitary (15%). Accurate and timely diagnosis can minimize mortality risks and the application of automated classification tools have proven to provide greater efficiency and interpretive efficacy than manual techniques alone.

### Data

The data was created by Sartaj Sartajbhuvaji from the combination of two Kaggle repositories provided by Navoneel Chakrabarty and Swati Kanchan. Mislabeled images were removed from the image set by his team under guidance of Dr. Shashikani Ubhe in September of 2019. The set contained 394 images consisting of the 3 most common brain tumors: Glioma, Meningioma and Pituitary as well as a control group of healthy patients.

### Features

The Capsule Neural Network was proposed by Geoffrey Hinton et al. in 2017 as a means of improving the Computer Vision capabilities of the Convolutional Neural Network architecture by way of 'inverse rendering'. This research provides a comparison between the efficacy and efficiency of translational invariance and equivariance as it relates to these types of deep learning solutions.

### Technologies

This implementation makes use of the Tensorflow machine learning platform as a backend to the Keras deep learning API along with various overhead library tools such as Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Pytorch, IPython and Matplotlib.

### Results

Both of the models performed extremely well considering they achieved over 98% accuracy on the test data including precision and recall metrics, although the capsule approach required half as many training epochs to accomplish this standard. As a result, I would choose the Capsule Neural Network over the Convolutional Neural Network because it has proven to be better at generalizing to new data and the design requires fewer training examples to accomplish the overall objectives.

### Future Goals

Future areas of improvement include a more comprehensive analysis of the classification efficiency of the capsule network over the convolutional model within this data set. This would include a deeper level of hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation so the computational hardware capabilities would probably need to be extended. In addition, greater domain knowledge might also provide additional insights into future model enhancements and implementation techniques.
